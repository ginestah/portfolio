        With a background in biology and climbing instruction, I bring a
        detail-oriented, driven, and communicative personality to the table. I
        leverage my experience in teaching and science to break down
        information, teach complex ideas and effectively test and troubleshoot.
        <br />
        <br />I am looking for a position with a environmentally conscious
        business model, and a fun engaging culture. I have an eagerness to learn
        new tech, and the proven ability to do so effectively, and quickly.
